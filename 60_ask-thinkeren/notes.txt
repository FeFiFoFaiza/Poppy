DISCOS
 - We failed lol
 - I have a bad memory so it's not my fault 
   I couldn't remember who I got and gave cards to
 - Pretty sure it was supposed to show mergesort

QCC
 - How in the world was this supposed to work? 
   Once everyone has a card yea its's all sorted. But it's like 40smth 
   separate decks. How do you condense it all yet keep it sorted yet not be able
   to look at the cards as they come to you. 

THINKER FIRMWARE
 - You got more than one card? Split it up (or well try to) and give it to
   other people without any cards
 - You got 0 cards? Accept whatever comes to you
 - You got 1 card? Return it back from whenst it came from
 - Got your og deck back? Give it to wherever you've inherited it from
