Java is written in a specific format:

public class {

      public static void m(int a, String b){
      // dostuff
      }
}

Make sure to keep track of {curly brackets} and always include ;

Can't understand how to do stack diagram- but I can see why it would be useful in reading code as it keeps tracks of methods and parameters.
