HW65: How Many Queens Can a Thinker Place, If a Thinker Can Places Queens...
2022-02-16
time spent: 2.5 hrs...

DISCOS:
    - Turns out I had the right idea but I overcomplicated the actual code haha
    - You do not need to outright say that Queens == size bc the thing goes thru every column
    - If you don't want to waste paper, use Lichess Board Editor

QCC:
    - Gives us the same stuff all the time, should we make the first row random instead?
    - This output aint spaced out nicely :(
    - 100 rows abt to break mi computadora 

ALGO: 
Place the first queen (0,0)
Check if you can place a queen in the next column
    If you can keep on going (call on method again)
    If not then backtrack by removing the current Queen and go to the next available space
