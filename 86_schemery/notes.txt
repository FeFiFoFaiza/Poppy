time spent: 2.3hr

got two stacks bc it seems like unload needs one but i need one too
or
i do unload but instead of closing parens its open ones

im pretty sure this is all inefficient lol

THE ALGO WAS WRONG HAHA
god new algo is soooo much easier and makes sense...if only if i used two stacks earlier :D

line 38: you want the parens it's the * you gotta look out for
 - before I used isNumber() and thats what messed me up 
 - this literally cost me an hour HAHAHAHAHAHHA

WRITING IT DOWN IS THE BEST WAY TO GO DOWN IN HISTORY
